# Corten â€” an experiment in implementing Forth in Rust

Corten is currently not much more than the first draft of an experiment for
discovering [Rust][] by bootstrapping a minimal programming system, and as far
as minimal goes, it's hard to beat [Forth][]. Also, I've been on a
[Canon Cat][cat] research binge, recently.

I have way more design intuition with dynamically-typed OO than with any other
paradigm, so I'm interested in understanding how to architect the program the
Rust way.
